# Wix Metaverse Guestlist Integration

This is a documentation-based GitHub repo for my Wix Studio project, which connects a live Contact Us page to a guestlist system and a Spatial metaverse space.

## 🌐 Live Website
https://bhawnabhadana89.wixstudio.com/my-site-2

## 🌀 Metaverse Space
https://www.spatial.io/s/absolute_giraffe886s-Bespoke-Area-686a28bb9864de1814e0f593

## 🔁 Guestlist Automation
Form submissions on the Wix Contact Us page trigger an automated email that sends users the metaverse access link via Wix Automations. This simulates a guestlist-restricted space.

## 📩 How It Works
1. User submits their name/email on the site
2. Wix automation triggers an email with the metaverse invite
3. Only those on the list receive the access link

## 🔍 Notes
- This is a no-code implementation using Wix Studio and Spatial.io
- GitHub is used here to document and track the integration, as Wix doesn’t support direct GitHub deployment
